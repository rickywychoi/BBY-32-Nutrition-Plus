                <p>Our team is devoted to guaranteeing the health of individuals
                     during COVID-19. These circumstances call for an even greater
                     need to take care of our health, but it's important to do so 
                     on an everyday basis. Our application helps everyone to easily
                     find their individual requirements, but also to be able to
                     evaluate their meals and common snacks. Overcoming the need to 
                     find resources on different sites will also help users' willingness
                     to take care of their health. By taking care of our individual 
                     health and being aware of current circumstances, the
                     world will be able to overcome this pandemic sooner than later.
